     Buttermilk - Eastern and Central U.S.

     Report 31 - Released on August 02, 2018

     CENTRAL: Dry buttermilk low-end prices firmed on what has been a busier trading week than
     average for this summer. Drying has been slower and primarily based on contracts. Thus, even
     light demand has overtaken very tight supplies. Some resales took place at above the current
     range, but first/spot sales are reported in at just around the $.80 mark. Some producers
     have reported that drying is beginning to perk up, and lighter condensed skim supplies have
     provided the dryer time to prepare and eventually offer some buttermilk powder on the spot
     market. Like with most dairy powders, near term buttermilk market tones are bullish.

     EAST: Dry buttermilk market prices are strengthening. The availability in cash markets is
     spotty at best, but regular accounts are able to secure loads in a timely fashion. Some
     buyers seeking dry buttermilk are making spot purchases from a different region. Stocks, in
     general, are tight in the East. Production runs can be intermittent, as good condensed
     buttermilk demand eases drying rates. With the upward movement in price, the dry buttermilk
     market tone maintains an unsettledness.
     Prices for: Eastern and Central U.S., All First Sales, F.O.B., Conventional, and Edible
     Buttermilk
     Price Range ; $/LB:                                    .7800 - .8200
